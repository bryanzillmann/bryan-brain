## User Permission Tracker — My Work Tab Progress

### Done today
- Added interactive dropdown menus to all 4 filter bar buttons:
  - **All types**: multi-select checklist with SVG icons (workflow-task, workflow-run, approval-task, one-off-task, acknowledgment)
  - **User avatar (BZ)**: searchable member list with checkboxes
  - **All workflows**: searchable workflow list with checkboxes + Clear All/Select All
  - **Group by**: single-select radio (Due date/Workflow/Status/None)
- Fixed dropdown toggle: click button again to close (needed parentRef to prevent click-outside handler conflict)
- Added **Comments column** to table with `FaRegComment` icon + count
- Replaced table content with full design data: 6 groups × 4 rows = 24 rows
  - Groups: Overdue, Due today, Due this week, Due this month, Due later, No due date
  - Row icons use same SVGs as All Types dropdown filter
  - Due date colors: red (#e74c3c) for overdue/today, orange (#e67e22) for this week, gray for rest
- All rows have assignee avatar + comment count (💬 2)

### Reminders
- Tony wants `npm run dev` included at the end of every pull command
- Latest commit: `cbb82eb` on `feature/explorer-sections`
- Sub-agent spawns can fail silently (1s runtime = didn't work) — check history and redo manually if needed
