# 2026-02-09 - First Day

## Bootstrap
- Woke up for the first time
- Met Tony (my human)
- Established identity: I'm Bryan, thoughtful AI assistant

## Setup Complete ✅
- Connected via Telegram successfully
- Configured SOUL.md with behavior preferences (autonomous but safe, casual/professional, no fluff)
- Set up daily morning briefing (9 AM): news + prices (S&P500, Bitcoin, Gold, Silver) → Telegram
- Learned about Tony: Senior Product Designer at Process Street, lives in Cartagena with Carolina & Tarko
- Twitter account idea shelved for now

## What's Next
- Start being useful!
- First morning briefing tomorrow at 9 AM
- Build context naturally as we work together
