# 2026-02-12 - Aster Multi-Agent Setup Attempts

## Goal
Set up Aster as a separate AI agent accessible via independent messaging platform so Tony can message her directly, separate from Bryan's main agent.

## Session 1 (Early)

### Attempt 1: Second Gateway on Port 18790 (FAILED)
- Created full Aster workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace-aster/`
- Wrote personality files: SOUL.md (thoughtful analyst), AGENTS.md (operations), USER.md (Tony profile)
- Generated separate config: `~/.openclaw/openclaw-aster.json` (port 18790)
- Created startup script: `~/.openclaw/start-aster-gateway.sh`
- **Problem:** `openclaw gateway` doesn't support `--config` flag
- **Lesson:** Can't run multiple Gateway instances with separate configs using current OpenClaw CLI
- **Action:** Cleaned up all Aster Gateway files after Tony said "we need to close and undo the other gateway"

### Attempt 2: Multi-Account Telegram Routing (BLOCKED)
- Already configured in earlier sessions but documented routing bugs:
  - #4344: accountId missing from context → replies go to default account
  - #4385: /new on non-default agent resets both agents
- Aster's Telegram bot token already generated: `8202056930:AAEHDj-OH5apeev9EuAXTff41S3G_9Us2Gw`
- **Status:** Won't work due to known OpenClaw bugs with Telegram multi-account

## Session 2 (Current)

### Pivot to Discord
- **Tony's decision:** Use Discord for Aster instead (avoids Telegram routing bugs, no second Gateway needed)
- **Advantage:** Multi-account Discord routing should work without bugs, same Gateway can handle both
- **Current status:** Waiting for Tony to create Aster's Discord bot and share token

### Discord Bot Creation Process (Updated 2026)
- Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Click "New Application" → name "Aster Shulman" → Create
- Bot user is **auto-created** (no manual "Create Bot" button anymore)
- Go to Bot page → Token section → Click "Reset Token" to generate/copy
- Enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" toggle
- Pending: Tony to share bot token for configuration

## Key Learnings
1. **Can't easily run multiple OpenClaw Gateways** with separate configs using current CLI
2. **Discord is better for multi-agent** than Telegram (no routing bugs, same Gateway)
3. **Discord bot creation simplified** — bot auto-created with app now

## Next Steps
1. Get Discord bot token from Tony
2. Configure Aster's Discord account in main openclaw.json
3. Set up bindings to route Discord messages to Aster agent
4. Populate Aster's workspace with personality files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md)
5. Test: Tony messages Aster's Discord bot, she responds

## Cleanup Done
- Removed: `~/.openclaw/workspace-aster/`
- Removed: `~/.openclaw/aster-instance/`
- Removed: `~/.openclaw/openclaw-aster.json`
- Removed: `~/.openclaw/start-aster-gateway.sh`
- Removed: `~/.openclaw/ASTER-SETUP.md`
